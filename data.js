  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">To have a safe and successful selling experience on Vinted, simply follow these tips:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span>
  </p>
  <div>1. Build<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a trusted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> profile, adjust your settings</span></div>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add your profile picture and </span><a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/help/406?access_channel=hc_topics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">verify your account</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to show </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re a real person</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write something about yourself in the "About you" section.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to exclude certain carriers from your listings, </span><a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/help/447?access_channel=hc_topics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adjust your shipping options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></li>
  </ul>
  <div>2. List your items</div>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out </span><a href="https://vinted.co.uk/catalog-rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what you can sell on Vinted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a few nice, clear </span><a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/help/48?access_channel=hc_topics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photos of the item</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If it’s an item by a well-known brand, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">add at least 5 pictures of it to show its authenticity.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be specific and honest in the </span><a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/help/49?access_channel=hc_topics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">item's description</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and select the correct </span><a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/help/51?access_channel=hc_topics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parcel size</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>

    <blockquote>
      <div>
        <div><strong>Note</strong></div>
        <div><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you upload an item, it might get screened automatically to go through</span><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a standard check to make sure it follows our </span><a href="https://vinted.co.uk/catalog-rules">Catalogue Rules</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and guidelines for selling. Normally, it takes up to 1 minute but, in some cases, can take up to 1 or 2 days.</span></div>
